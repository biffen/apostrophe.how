  <p>&#x261B;&nbsp;This page teaches you most of what you need to know about apostrophes
    if you plan to write something in English.</p>

  <p><small>Other languages will have their own rules. And even foreign
    phrases and loan words might bend the rules when used within

        <p>An apostrophe</p>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>An <q>apostrophe</q> is a small punctuation character, appearing as a small line
      among the tops of characters. It has its well-defined use in written English,
      yet it’s one of those things even fluent writers seem to get wrong at times.</p>

    <p>This page attempts to teach you where and how to use apostrophes, and when to
      refrain. Naturally, there will always be disagreements and exceptions to rules,
      but this page tries to stay simple and neutral.</p>

    <p>This page also limits itself to how apostrophes are used in <em>the
      English language</em>.</p>

    <h2>When to Use an Apostrophe</h2>

    <p>Apostrophes are used to indicate two things; possession and omission.
    </p>

    <section id="possession">

      <h3>Possession</h3>

      <p>In English, possession is indicated using an apostrophe followed by an S. The
        latter is sometimes skipped, but the apostrophe should
        <em>always</em> be present.

    </section>
    <!-- possession -->

    <section id="omission">

      <h3>Omission</h3>

      <p>Sometimes characters are left out of a word, or set of words, often mimicking
        spoken language. Such omission is often indicated with an apostrophe. Some
        common examples are:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>you’re</dt>
        <dd>Short for
          <q>you are</q>
        </dd>

        <dt>don’t</dt>
        <dd>For
          <q>do not</q>
        </dd>

        <dt>it’s</dt>
        <dd>For
          <q>it is</q>
        </dd>

        <dt>&#x2026;</dt>
      </dl>

      <p>See the pattern? (Hint: The apostrophe <q>represents</q> the omitted characters.)</p>

    <h2>When <em>not</em> to Use an Apostrophe</h2>

    <p>Since the rules for when apostrophes should be used are rather simple, it should
      be as simple to avoid using apostrophes in all other situations. Yet there
      are a few common mistakes that people keep making:
    </p>

    <section id="plural">

      <h3>Plural</h3>

      <p>Plural forms in English should <em>not</em> have an apostrophe.</p>

      <p>Confusion <em>may</em> arise when dealing with possessive plurals. But it’s
        the possessive part that calls for the apostrophe, as usual.
      </p>

      <p><em>An exception</em> is when making plural forms of letters and numbers, where
        some styles use an apostrophe to avoid ambiguity. E.g. 1’s, a’s, B’s, etc.</p>

    </section>
    <!-- plural -->

    <section id="possessive_pronouns">

      <h3>Possessive Pronouns</h3>

      <p>Possessive pronouns should <em>never</em> have an apostrophe, even when they
        end in an S. They are possessive enough as they are.</p>

      <p>So it’s: yours, his, hers, its, ours and theirs.</p>

    </section>
    <!-- possessive_pronouns -->

    <section id="here_comes_another_s">

      <h3><q>Oh <span title="shoot" >&#x1F4A9;</span>, here comes another S!</q></h3>

      <p>Some people, who are perhaps unsure about the rules of apostrophes, seem to
        think that adding one <q>won’t hurt</q>. They also seem to think that apostrophes
        have a special relationship with the letter S. So they will put an apostrophe
        before virtually every S. This phenomenon is called <q>greengrocers’ apostrophe</q>,
        or
        <q>oh-&#x1F4A9;-here-comes-another-S syndrome</q>.</p>

      <p>A superfluous apostrophe is as bad as a missing one. It hinders readability
        and conveys ignorance. Learn where the apostrophes go. It’s not that hard,
        as you can see above.</p>

  <section id="which">

    <h2>Which Character to Use</h2>

    <figure>
      <blockquote>
        <p style="font-size: 5em;">&#x2019;&nbsp;&#x0027;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <figcaption>
        <p>An apostrophe (left) and a <q>typewriter apostrophe</q> (right)</p>
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>There are a number of characters that can be used as an apostrophe. Knowing which
      one to use can seem tricky, but let’s try to work it out.
    </p>

    <p>The first choice to make is whether to use <q>curly</q> or
      <q>straight</q> apostrophes, also known as typewriter apostrophes. This is
      a matter of style and taste <em>only</em>. Curly should be the default, but
      if you’re using straight quotes ('' and "" as opposed to ‘’ and “”) you should
      use straight apostrophes to match.</p>

    <p>In informal settings, using typewriter apostrophes is fine, and they’re often
      easier to type. So unless you’re writing something official, don’t worry too
      much about it.</p>

    <p>When using curly apostrophes there are, unfortunately, two different characters
      from which to choose: &#x2019; (U+2019 RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK) or &#x02BC;
      (U+02BC MODIFIER LETTER APOSTROPHE). They may, and should, appear equal to
      the naked eye; the difference is quite technical.</p>

    <p>There are arguments for and against the use of both versions, and we won’t go
      into that debate here. Pick one and stick to it.</p>

    <section id="what_not">

      <h3>What <em>Not</em> to Use</h3>

      <p>Then there are a lot of characters that <em>shouldn’t</em> be used for apostrophes.
        Of course, all characters except the ones listed above are out of the question,
        but some in particular seem to be in frequent misuse.</p>

      <section id="accents">

        <h4>Accents</h4>

        <figure>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              <del>Don&#x2060;´&#x2060;t</del>
              <br/>
              <del>Don&#x2060;`&#x2060;t</del>
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <figcaption>
            <p>Don’t use accents as if they are apostrophes</p>
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>A common mistake is to use an accent (acute (´) or grave (`)) where one should
          use an apostrophe. <em>This is wrong!</em> And there’s no excuse for doing
          so.

        <h4>Things That Look Like Apostrophes</h4>

      <h3><q>Which key do I press?</q></h3>

      <p>How to type an apostrophe will depend on both software and hardware.
      </p>

      <p>The method of inserting a curly apostrophe depends on the operating system:
      </p>

      <dl>

        <dt>Apple OS X</dt>
        <dd>
          <kbd>⌥&#x200A;Option</kbd> + <kbd>⇧&#x200A;Shift</kbd> + <kbd>]</kbd>
        </dd>

        <dt>GNU/Linux</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>It varies, but usually one of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>⇧&#x200A;Shift</kbd> + <kbd>U</kbd>, <kbd>2</kbd>              <kbd>0</kbd> <kbd>1</kbd> <kbd>9</kbd>
            </li>
            <li>
              <kbd>AltGr</kbd> + <kbd>⇧&#x200A;Shift</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd>
            </li>
            <li>
              <kbd>AltGr</kbd> + <kbd>⇧&#x200A;Shift</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd>
            </li>
            <li>
              <kbd>Compose</kbd> + <kbd>'</kbd> + <kbd>&gt;</kbd>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </dd>

        <dt>Microsoft Windows</dt>
        <dd>
          <kbd>Alt</kbd> +
          <kbd>0</kbd>
          <kbd>1</kbd>
          <kbd>4</kbd>
          <kbd>6</kbd>
        </dd>

      </dl>

      <p>Typing a typewriter apostrophe is usually easier: It’s often a single key-press.
        The location of the key depends on the keyboard layout used, but it tends
        to appear near the <kbd>↵&#x200A;Enter</kbd> key.
      </p>

      <p>In some cases, typing a typewriter apostrophe will in fact insert the curly
        variant. (This is commonly referred to as <q>smart
        quotes</q>.)</p>

      <p>If you find that an apostrophe does not immediately appear, but requires an
        other key-press, <em>watch out!</em> You may be on your way to erroneously
        use an accent (see <a href="#accents">Accents</a> above).
